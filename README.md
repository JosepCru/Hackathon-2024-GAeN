# ðŸ§¬ **Automated Nanoparticle Detection in Microscope Images**

## **Overview**  
This project automates the detection and localization of nanoparticles in microscope images, a traditionally manual and time-consuming task. Using **machine learning** models and an intuitive **user interface**, researchers can efficiently analyze samples, saving significant time and effort.

The system includes:  
1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays the microscope's current view, detects nanoparticles, and provides real-time results.  
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Predicts the probability of nanoparticles, counts them, and identifies their centers.  
3. **Automated Navigation**: Systematically scans the sample, optimizing microscope movement to locate nanoparticles efficiently.

## **Features**  
- **Real-Time Detection**: Identifies nanoparticles, their quantity, and their coordinates from 256x256 microscope image sections.  
- **Large Image Analysis**: Processes large 1024x1024 images by dividing them into smaller grids.  
- **Spiral Scanning**: Automatically navigates through the sample, skipping areas without nanoparticles for maximum efficiency.  
- **Visualization**: Tracks microscope movements and displays results in an intuitive interface.  
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates labeled datasets to train and validate machine learning models.

## **Getting Started**  

### Prerequisites  
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Required Python libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pytorch hyperspy atomai matplotlib opencv-python
  ```  
- A working microscope setup (if applicable) or access to images for testing.  

### Project Setup  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martatorrenss/nanoparticle-detector.git (????)
   cd nanoparticle-detector
   ```  

2. Prepare your datasets:  
   - Place the microscope images and corresponding label maps into the `data/` directory.  
   - Use the synthetic data generation script (`data_generator.py`) to create augmented datasets if needed.

3. Train the machine learning models:  
   - Modify the paths and hyperparameters in the `train_model.py` script.  
   - Run the training process:  
     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```  
   - Models will be saved to the `models/` directory.

4. Run the interface with the automated navigator:  
   ```bash
   python main_interface.py
   ```

## **How It Works**  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Real and synthetic microscope images are collected and labeled.  
   - Images are split into 128x128 regions for model training.  

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Two machine learning models (Tecnai and Spectra) are trained to:  
     - Predict nanoparticle probability.  
     - Return the number of nanoparticles and their center coordinates.

3. **Automated Navigation**:  
   - The microscope window scans a 1024x1024 image grid-by-grid.  
   - Spiral movement optimizes search efficiency, skipping empty grids.  
   - When nanoparticles are detected, the navigator focuses on high-probability regions.

4. **User Interface**:  
   - Displays the microscope's current view.  
   - Shows nanoparticle counts, coordinates, and navigation paths in real time.

## **Results**

- **Accelerates analysis** by automating nanoparticle detection.
